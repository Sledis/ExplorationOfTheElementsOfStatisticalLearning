# ExplorationOfTheElementsOfStatisticalLearning
This repository is to explore parts of the book The Elements of Statistical Learning that I find interesting.

This repository will be a sandbox for parts of EoSL that I feel like exploring further.
In ComparisonOfStandardFormulaVsSphering we look at the diferences between two methods of performing linear discriminant analysis, exploring if numerical instabilites occur and the affect on performance.
